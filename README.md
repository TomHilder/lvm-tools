# lvm_tools

Lightweight wrapper of LVM DRP data with an emphasis on modularity. Allows for lazy reading via dask, especially useful for fitting large models. Designed for use with spectrospatial models via [spectracles](https://github.com/TomHilder/spectracles) but probably useful for other things too.

Feel free to contact me personally if you have any questions at all.
